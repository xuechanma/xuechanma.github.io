**<u>Impressive points:</u>**

- **Carbon sequestration** was defined as organic Carbon (C) stored for over 100 years.
- Marine protected areas (MPA) had no effect on **genetic diversity**.
- Conservation had no effect on C sequestration by **tidal marshes**.
- No studies documented the effect of protection on the quantity of sequestered C originating from **fish** or **macroalgae (seaweed)** biomass.
- More research is needed to quantify the **exportation rates** of organic C from fish biomass toward sediments.
- **Seagrass** increased local Ph, and **mangroves** and **macroalgae** decreased it.
- No studies have assessed whether **wave attenuation** is enhanced when habitats are in an MPA.
- **Connectivity** and **phenotypic plasticity** were not addressed by any studies.
- The three indicators for which we found negative outcomes of MPAs were **user rights**, **conflict**, and **costs** (used to measure agency, social organization, and assets pathways, respectively).
- Habitats with high C sequestration potential but low spatial extent (e.g., **mangroves** and **seagrass**) translate into a high mitigation potential per surface area but low mitigation potential at the global scale. 
- Conversely, **fish** and **sediments** have lower mitigation potential per surface area but can play an important role in global climate mitigation because of their vast extent.
- The ability of MPAs to enhance ecological adaptation results mostly from **alleviation of fishing pressure**, which represents a minor threat to corals in comparison with temperature rise and acidification.
- Methodology: **vote counting**; **meta-analytical approach**
