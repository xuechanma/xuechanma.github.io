- **19 January 2023**: GitHub Pages pages build and deployment failures happened many times. I figured out the reason for the first failure - it was because I did not put the right file extension name for a newly added post. I had no idea for the remaining 10+ failures. I kept trying - removed the new file and re-added it back etc. Finnaly somehow the build and deployment was successful. 

- **28 January 2023**: On 23 January, Google Colab GPU (unpaid account) stopped working with a message saying usage limit exceeded, after I started to use it for one for two days. Somehow GPU becomes reusable again now.
